"""Tests for the stale-manifest hint in fetch's sha256-mismatch error.

Regression: a published GitHub release had its container asset
re-uploaded out-of-band (215 MB -> 296 MB) without re-running
`ltvm target publish` to refresh the manifest.  Fetch correctly
refused, but the error said only 'sha256 mismatch' -- the user had
to dig through GitHub's asset metadata to figure out the cause.
The size delta is a cheap signal that the release was republished,
so surface it in the error message.
