"""Podman subprocess wrapper with Ctrl-C / SIGTERM cleanup.

Long-running `podman run ...` invocations (kernel build, Lustre
build, MOFED kmod build) used to orphan their containers and the
inner `make -j28` when the user hit Ctrl-C.  The Python wrapper
died; the container and its inner build kept running for minutes,
eating cores and occasionally leaving partial files in staging.

``run_podman_with_cleanup`` wraps :func:`subprocess.run` with two
additions:

  1. ``podman run`` gets a ``--cidfile`` injected so we know the
     container id even if we never got to read stdout.
  2. SIGINT / SIGTERM received by the parent are translated into
     ``podman kill --signal TERM <cid>`` followed (after a brief
     grace period) by ``podman kill --signal KILL <cid>`` and a
     final ``killpg(SIGKILL)`` belt on the podman child's process
     group.

The child runs in its own session via ``preexec_fn=os.setsid`` so
the terminal's process-group SIGINT doesn't auto-kill it before
we've had a chance to tell podman to tear down the container
cleanly.

    """``subprocess.run``-style wrapper that kills the container on signal.

    Behaves like ``subprocess.run(cmd, check=check, **kwargs)`` in
    the happy path: stdout/stderr flow to the parent's terminal by
    default, the returncode is returned, and ``check=True`` still
    raises :class:`subprocess.CalledProcessError` on non-zero exit.

    The helper only modifies ``cmd`` when it starts with
    ``["podman", "run", ...]``.  Other ``podman`` subcommands
    (``build``, ``image exists``, ``save``, etc.) are passed
    through unchanged -- they're short-lived and Ctrl-C already
    DTRT for them.

    When a SIGINT or SIGTERM arrives while the child is running,
    the helper:

      1. reads the cidfile
      2. runs ``podman kill --signal TERM <cid>`` (best-effort)
      3. waits up to ``_GRACE_SECONDS`` for podman to exit
      4. if still alive: ``podman kill --signal KILL <cid>`` plus
         ``killpg(SIGKILL)`` on the podman process group
      5. restores the previous signal handlers and re-raises
         :class:`KeyboardInterrupt` (for SIGINT) or exits the
         process (for SIGTERM)

    Previous handlers are always restored on exit via ``finally``.

    ``cidfile`` note: podman refuses to start if ``--cidfile``
    points at an already-existing path, so we use
    :func:`tempfile.mkstemp` then immediately unlink the empty
    file before passing the path to podman.
