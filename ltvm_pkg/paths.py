"""Single source of truth for the ltvm repo root.

target_config.py and vm_state.py both need to resolve where outputs
live.  Round 19 found the helper duplicated in both modules with a
comment literally saying "must agree with the other one" -- a
maintenance bomb waiting to go off.  This module is the canonical
implementation; both consumers re-export the same function so any
future changes happen in exactly one place.

We deliberately avoid imports beyond pathlib/os so this can be pulled
in by every other module without circular-import risk.

    .ko files are ELF relocatable objects with a ``.modinfo`` section

    is regular enough that we can scan the whole file rather than
