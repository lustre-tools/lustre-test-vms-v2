"""Deploy / llmount subcommands.

cmd_deploy is the big one: auto-detects target from VM metadata,
picks up a bundled snapshot from ``ltvm fetch`` when present, else
runs ``ltvm build lustre`` into per-kernel staging, then calls
``deploy_to_vm`` to rsync modules and userland into the VM.

cmd_llmount is a thin wrapper around vm_commands.cmd_llmount.
